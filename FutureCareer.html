                    <center> 
												An epidemiologist is a scientist who researches the patterns and possible causes of disease outbreaks in the world before, during, and after they begin. It is an extremely specialized career, with few job offerings which are almost all from either private hospitals or the Center of Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). I want to work as an Epidemic Intelligence Service (EIS) Officer, who travels the world to research diseases in the field as they happen and find ways to prevent, treat, and stop infectious disease. To be an EIS officer, you are required to have: a doctorate degree, medical degree, post-doctoral program qualifications, and research experience. The average annual salary for an epidemiologist is $70,000.
