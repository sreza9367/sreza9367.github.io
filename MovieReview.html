											<p> Synopsis </p>
											<p> "Rogue One: A Star Wars Story" is a science fiction epic. A part of the new anthology series spin off of the Star Wars franchise, the story revolves around a group of unlikely heroes suddenly thrust in the war between the dark and the light. The fight for their lives become a fight for something bigger than themselves when they find themselves trying to steal the Death Star plans and save the rebellion. <p>

											<p> Personal Review </p>
                    	<p> "Rogue One," directed by Gareth Edwards, is drastically different from the hero's tale template of the rest of the series franchise. With instead of a clear division between the jedi and sith, the light and the dark, the story is incredibly grey. Though the main characters are supposedly "heroes," their willingness to do questionable deeds for the cause destroys the idyllic war epic the rest of the series portrays and instead lets the reality and truth of real war seep through. Out of the entire franchise, "Rogue One" is the most complex, interesting, realistic, and, in my opinion, best movie written. (I've watched it eight times, three times in the theatres) </p>
