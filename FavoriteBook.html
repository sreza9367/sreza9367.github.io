			    <p> <i> Ender's Game </i> by Orson Scott Card is a science fiction novel published in 1985. It follows a young strategy genius Andrew "Ender" Wiggins, also known as "Third" by his school bullies for being the third child born to two parents in a world where population is controlled and only two children are allocated per couple. Ender is followed through his journey into Battle School and then Commander School so that he can prepare to lead humanity in the war to end all wars against the foul and hostile Buggers, an insectoid alien species that would have wiped out everyone on Earth if it wasn't for the infamous general	Mazer Rackham. However, Ender soon learns, along with his older brother and sister, Peter and Valentine, that age is a powerful and crippling deficit in the world of politics. </p> <!-- End summary -->

    					<td> Ender is the genius strategist selected to be the one hero to save all of humanity against the Buggers. Sent to Battle School at the age of nine, he proves himself capable against foes young and old alike all the way up to Commander School, where he arrives three years younger than his peers. He is lonely, isolated, and manipulated, but he always does what he believes is best in the smartest way possible. Through the entire novel, he has the clearest "morality" in today's society's terms. </td>
    					<td> Valentine is Ender's oldest sister, and the only person who loves Ender unconditionally and would do anything to keep him safe. She was the middle child of their family and thought to have been the genius hero but failed to meet the bar, like her older brother. Still, she finds her inner calling as a genius through writing. Though also moral, she isn't afraid to do questionable deeds if it gets her what she wants, making her more similar to her brother Peter than she wants to be. </td>
    					<td> Peter Wiggins is the oldest child in the Wiggins family, and the first failure. Thus, he tends to be cruel to his younger siblings, often beating them and abusing them. He is shown through out the book to have slight psychopathic tendencies but has the same cunning edge as his siblings and uses those skills to do what he does best: manipulate for power. </td>
							<td> Mazer Rackham is the first genius strategist who saved humanity in the first Bugger War. Considered a legend, he becomes Ender's mentor and close friend after Ender completes Commander School, and prepares him best he can for the war Ender is meant to win. </td>
							<td> Colonel Graff is the military commander who tracks and later selects Ender to be general for the Bugger War. He is a avid supporter of Ender, and also does what he believes is best for Ender when he can. Yet, as a military personal, and as an adult, he is often forced to consider the larger picture of saving humanity, or saving Ender's innocence.

				<p> Personal Testimony </p>
				<p text-align:"right"> <i> Ender's Game </i> is my favorite book because it has such a rich story to it. It can be read as a simple science fiction war novel but it is one of the most real war novels I've ever read. The strategy and techniques, the plans and ideas, that Ender and his sibilings think up of gives the novel a kind of thriller feel that I've never been able to find since. Everytime I read this book I find something new to love about it, whether it be the very real abuse of child innocence to the incredible logic and philosphy found in the novel that makes the reader question morality. </p>
