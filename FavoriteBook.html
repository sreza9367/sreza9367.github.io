			    <p> <i> Ender's Game </i> by Orson Scott Card is a science fiction novel published in 1985. It follows a young strategy genius Andrew "Ender" Wiggins, also known as "Third" by his school bullies for being the third child born to two parents in a world where population is controlled and only two children are allocated per couple. Ender is followed through his journey into Battle School and then Commander School so that he can prepare to lead humanity in the war to end all wars against the foul and hostile Buggers, an insectoid alien species that would have wiped out everyone on Earth if it wasn't for the infamous general	Mazer Rackham. However, Ender soon learns, along with his older brother and sister, Peter and Valentine, that age is a powerful and crippling deficit in the world of politics. </p> <!-- End summary -->
